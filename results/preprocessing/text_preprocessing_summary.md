# Text Preprocessing Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 1.5 (Text Preprocessing Pipeline) from Sprint 1. The text preprocessing pipeline includes cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and optional stemming or lemmatization of OCR text from document images.

## Implementation Details

The implementation can be found in `src/preprocessing.py` in the `preprocess_text()` function, which performs the following steps:

1. **Text Cleaning**:
   - Convert text to lowercase
   - Remove punctuation, numbers, and special characters using regex
   - Remove excess whitespace

2. **Tokenization**:
   - Split text into individual words using whitespace-based tokenization
   - This provides a robust, dependency-light approach compared to NLTK's word_tokenize

3. **Stopword Removal**:
   - Optional removal of common English stopwords
   - Uses NLTK's stopwords corpus with graceful fallback if not available

4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**:
   - Optional stemming using NLTK's PorterStemmer
   - Preferred lemmatization using spaCy with NLTK WordNetLemmatizer as fallback
   - These options are mutually exclusive (lemmatization takes precedence)

5. **Post-processing**:
   - Filter out single-character tokens
   - Return a list of cleaned tokens

## Configuration Options

The `preprocess_text()` function accepts several parameters to control its behavior:

- `text`: The input OCR text to process
- `remove_stopwords`: Whether to remove common English stopwords (default: True)
- `perform_stemming`: Whether to apply stemming to reduce words to their stems (default: False)
- `perform_lemmatization`: Whether to apply lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms (default: True)

## Testing and Evaluation

The preprocessing pipeline was tested on OCR text samples from all five document classes. Key statistics:

| Class | Avg Original Length | Avg Word Count | Avg Tokens (Default) | Avg Tokens (Stemming) |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| 0     | 1275.0              | 215.7          | 126.0                | 126.3                 |
| 2     | 370.0               | 58.7           | 37.7                 | 37.3                  |
| 4     | 515.7               | 77.3           | 58.3                 | 58.0                  |
| 6     | 1840.3              | 305.7          | 190.7                | 190.3                 |
| 9     | 1957.3              | 311.7          | 188.3                | 187.3                 |

On average, stopword removal decreased token count by approximately 30%, helping to focus on more meaningful terms.

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling to ensure robustness:

- Graceful handling of empty or malformed text input
- Try-except blocks for all potentially risky operations
- Appropriate logging with descriptive error messages
- Fallback mechanisms for unavailable NLTK or spaCy resources

## Conclusion

The text preprocessing pipeline satisfies all requirements specified in Task 1.5 of Sprint 1. It provides a flexible, robust approach to transform raw OCR text into clean tokens suitable for downstream natural language processing tasks. The implementation balances effectiveness and efficiency while handling different document types.
